.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a bundle management and distribution tool for the Janet programming
language.
An invocation of
.Nm
consists of
.Ql "jeep"
followed by a command.
.
.Ss Options
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Xo
.Fl l ,
.Fl "-local"
.Xc
Sets the
.Sy syspath
to
.Eo
.Pa ./_system
.Ec .
By default,
.Nm
performs operations in respect of the global syspath.
By using
.Fl "-local" ,
a user sets the syspath to
.Eo
.Pa ./_system
.Ec ,
the local syspath.
.It Xo
.Fl v ,
.Fl "-version"
.Xc
Prints the version of
.Nm .
.El
.Pp
Individual commands may support additional options.
These are written
.Em after
the command.
.
.Ss Commands
The
.Nm
utility comes with multiple commands.
More information about each command can be obtained by running
.Ql "jeep help <command>" .
.Pp
Global commands are commands that a user can run inside or outside
of a bundle directory.
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -offset 3n -compact
.It
.Cm install
- installs a Janet bundle
.It
.Cm list
- lists installed Janet bundles
.It
.Cm quickbin
- creates a binary executable
.It
.Cm uninstall
- uninstalls a Janet bundle
.El
.Pp
Bundle commands are commands that a user must run inside a bundle
directory.
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -offset 3n -compact
.It
.Cm api
- generates an API document for a bundle
.It
.Cm build
- builds the native targets of a bundle
.It
.Cm clean
- cleans directories in a bundle
.It
.Cm dep
- adds or removes dependencies from a bundle
.It
.Cm prep
- prepares dependencies for a bundle
.It
.Cm test
- runs tests for a bundle
.El

.Sh CONCEPTS
Bundles are the distributable units of code in Janet.
They are akin to packages in other languages.
.Pp
A bundle in Janet is a directory of files.
A valid bundle contains an
.Sy info file
and a
.Sy bundle script .
A bundle author can write functions that are registered to a
.Sy bundle hook
that is called during the bundle life cycle.
.Pp
For historical reasons,
Janet’s community includes
.Sy modern bundles
and
.Sy legacy bundles .
Jeep fully supports modern bundles.
It only supports the listing and uninstallation of legacy bundles.
.
.Ss Bundle Script
The
.Sy bundle script
may be located at:
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -offset 3n -compact
.It
.Eo
.Pa ./bundle/init.janet
.Ec
.It
.Eo
.Pa ./bundle.janet
.Ec
.El
.
.Ss Bundle Hooks
Janet’s
.Sy bundle hooks
are functions called during the bundle life cycle.
The bundle life cycle consists of an install phase and an uninstall
phase.
In the install phase,
the following hooks are called:
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -offset 3n -compact
.It
dependencies
.It
clean
.It
build
.It
install
.It
check
.El
.Pp
In the uninstall phase:
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -offset 3n -compact
.It
uninstall
.El
.Pp
A user binds a function to a bundle hook by providing a function
with the same name in the
.Sy bundle script .
In other words,
to bind to the check bundle hook,
the user would write this in the bundle script:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
\*(lpdefn check \(lBmanifest\(rB
  \*(lpeach file \*(lpget-in manifest \(lB:info :source :files\(rB\*(rp
    \*(lpperform-a-check file\*(rp\*(rp
  \*(lpprint \(dqall files checked\(dq\*(rp\*(rp
.Ed
.Pp
Every bundle hook receives the bundle manifest as its first argument.
The bundle manifest is a table that contains information related
to the bundle.
For bundle authors,
the most relevant piece of information is under the
.Ql ":info"
key.
The value is a table that contains the information in the
.Sy info file .
.
.Ss Info File
The
.Sy info file
may be located at:
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -offset 3n -compact
.It
.Eo
.Pa ./bundle/info.jdn
.Ec
.It
.Eo
.Pa ./info.jdn
.Ec
.El
.
.Ss Legacy Bundles
A
.Sy legacy bundle
is a directory that contains a
.Sy project file .
It is possible for a bundle to be both a legacy bundle and a
.Sy modern bundle .
.
.Ss Modern Bundles
A
.Sy modern bundle
is a directory that contains an
.Sy info file
and a
.Sy bundle script .
It is possible for a bundle to be both a
.Sy legacy bundle
and a modern bundle.
.
.Ss Project File
The
.Sy project file
is a file located at
.Eo
.Pa ./project.janet
.Ec .
It was introduced by JPM,
the Janet Project Manager.
It is supported by Janet-PM,
the next-generation project manager that is part of the Spork
library.
It is not supported by Jeep.
.
.Ss syspath
The
.Sy syspath
is a directory on the system that Janet uses for loading and
installing.
In the Jeep documentation,
a distinction is made between the global syspath and the local
syspath relative to a bundle.
.Pp
The global syspath is normally set to the value of
.Ev JANET_PATH .
If
.Ev JANET_PATH
is not set,
the global syspath may be set to a value baked in at compile-time
(on POSIX)
or nothing (on Windows).
.Pp
The local syspath relative to the root of the bundle is the
.Eo
.Pa ./_system
.Ec
directory.
.
.Sh EXAMPLES
To install a bundle from a remote URL:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ jeep install https://example\&.org/foo
.Ed
.Pp
To install a bundle from a remote URL to the local syspath:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ jeep -l install https://example\&.org/foo
.Ed
