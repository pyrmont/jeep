.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
builds native targets in a Janet bundle.
Native targets are built by calling the build function in the
bundle script.
.Pp
A bundle author will almost always want to call helper functions
from the build function.
The Spork library comes with a number of these functions and
Jeep can vendor the most common ones into the
.Eo
.Pa ./bundle
.Ec
directory:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ jeep prep build
.Ed
.Pp
This avoids an author needing to require a dependency be installed
by the end-user to build the bundle.
If additional modules from other bundles are required,
.Xr jeep-prep 1
supports vendoring additional dependencies.
For more information,
see the manpage for
.Xr jeep-prep 1 .

.Ar build-args
.Xc
Arguments to pass to the build
.Sy bundle hook .
The build
.Sy bundle hook
calls a function ``build' defined in your bundle script.
The first argument passed to that function is the bundle manifest.
The remaining arguments are
.Ar build-args .
.El

.Sy info file ,

.Sh EXAMPLES
To build the native targets for a bundle with no additional arguments:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ jeep build
.Ed
.Pp
To build the native targets for a bundle with additional arguments:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ jeep build -Dfoo -Dbar
.Ed
.Pp
Note that your build function will need to parse the arguments
passed to it.
