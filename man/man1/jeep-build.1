.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Ic \&jeep-build
builds native targets in a Janet project.
Native targets are built by calling the build function in the bundle script.
.Pp
A project author will almost always want to call helper functions from the build function.
The Spork library comes with a number of these functions and Jeep can vendor the most common ones into the 
.Eo
.Pa ./bundle
.Ec
directory:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ jeep prep build
.Ed
.Pp
This avoids an author needing to require a dependency be installed by the end-user to build the project.
If additional modules from other bundles are required,
.Xr jeep-prep 1\&
supports vendoring additional dependencies.
For more information,
see the manpage for 
.Xr jeep-prep 1\& .

Arguments to pass to the build \c
.Sy bundle hook .
The build \c
.Sy bundle hook
calls a function ``build' defined in your bundle script.
The first argument passed to that function is the bundle manifest.
The remaining arguments are 
.Ar \&build-args .
.El

.Sy info file ,

.Xr jeep 1\& .

.Sh EXAMPLES
To build the native targets for a project with no additional arguments:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ jeep build
.Ed
.Pp
To build the native targets for a project with additional arguments:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ jeep build -Dfoo -Dbar
.Ed
.Pp
Note that your build function will need to parse the arguments passed to it.
