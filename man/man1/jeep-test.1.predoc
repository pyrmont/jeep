NAME
====

**jeep-test** - run tests for a Janet project

SYNOPSIS
========

**jeep-test** [**-c** | **--check**] [**-f** _path_ | **--file** _path_] [**-F**
              _path_ | **--no-file** _path_] [**-t** _name_ | **--test** _name_]
              [**-T** _name_ | **--no-test** _name_] [**-R** | **--no-result**]
              [_check-args_]

DESCRIPTION
===========

**jeep-test** runs the tests in the `./test` directory. The default behaviour
tests every ``.janet`` file but the user can use command-line options to change
what tests are run.

Options
-------

- **-c**, **--check**:
  Runs the check __bundle hook__.

- **-f** _path_, **--file** _path_:
  Path of the file to run. Other files are not run. The path is relative to the
  `./test` directory. Can be used multiple times. This option is incompatible
  with **--no-file**.

- **-F** _path_, **--no-file** _path_:
  Path of the file not to run. Other files will be run. The path is relative to
  the `./test` directory. Can be used multiple times. This option is
  incompatible with **--file**.

- **-R**, **--no-result**:
  Skips printing the pass/fail result that Janet prints by default. This is most
  useful where your test files are responsible for printing their own results.

- **-t** _name_, **--test** _name_:
  Name of the test to run. Other tests are not run. Can be used multiple times.
  This option is incompatible with **--no-test**.

- **-T** _name_, **--no-test** _name_:
  Name of the test not to run. Other tests will be run. Can be used multiple
  times. This option is incompatible with **--test**.

- _check-args_:
  Arguments to pass to the check __bundle hook__. The check __bundle hook__
  calls a function ``check`` defined in the user's __bundle script__. The first
  argument passed to that function is the bundle manifest. The remaining
  arguments are _check-args_.

For more information about the __bundle script__ and __bundle hooks__, see
CONCEPTS in `jeep(1)`.

OPERATION
=========

**jeep-test** starts a separate instance of Janet for each file tested. By
default, this will be each file ending in ``.janet``. **jeep-test** provides for
two bases on which to control the tests which are run:

- __File-based__ -
  There are two mutually exclusive options:

  1. The user selects the files to run using **--file**. All other files are
     excluded.
  2. The user selects the files not to run using **--no-file**. All other files
     are included.

- __Test-based__ -
  There are two mutually exclusive options:

  1. The user selects the tests to run using **--test**. All other tests are
     excluded.
  2. The user selects the tests not to run using **--no-test**. All other tests
     are excluded.

  This basis requires the testing framework to respect the dynamic binding
  ``:tests`` (in the case of **--test**) or ``:skips`` (in the case of
  **--no-test**).

By default, the check __bundle hook__ is not run but this can be toggled with
the **--check** flag.

EXAMPLES
========

To test all the files in `./test`:

````
$ jeep test
````

To test only the file `./test/foo.janet`:

````
$ jeep test --file ./test/foo.janet
````

To skip the test ``bar``:

````
$ jeep test --no-test bar
````
