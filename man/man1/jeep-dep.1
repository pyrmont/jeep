.Ss Vendoring
A bundle’s
.Sy info file
can contain dependency information in an array/tuple mapped
to the
.Ql ":dependencies"
key.
By default,
dependencies that are added or removed using
.Nm
are added to or removed from this data structure.
Dependencies that are listed in this data structure are installed
into the
.Sy syspath .
This will either be the global syspath or
.Eo
.Pa ./_system
.Ec ,
the local syspath,
if the user is using the
.Fl "-local"
flag as described in
.Xr jeep 1 .
.Pp
Janet does not support the installation of multiple versions
of a dependency.
To avoid version conflicts,
a user may prefer to vendor dependencies.
.Nm
supports this with the
.Fl "-vendor"
option.
Vendored dependencies are listed under the
.Ql ":vendored"
keyword and then further listed under a string that represents
the directory into which the dependency will be vendored.
This allows a bundle author to vendor dependency for certain
purposes (such as building or testing)
by vendoring dependencies into different directories.
.Pp
For more information about the
.Sy info file ,
the
.Sy bundle script
and the
.Sy syspath ,
see CONCEPTS in
.Xr jeep 1 .

.Sh EXAMPLES
To add a dependency to the
.Sy info file :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ jeep dep https://example\&.org/foo\&.git
.Ed
.Pp
To remove a dependency from the
.Sy info file :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ jeep dep -r foo
.Ed
.Pp
To add two dependencies that will be vendored into the
.Eo
.Pa ./bundle
.Ec
directory:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ jeep dep --vendor bundle https://example\&.org/foo\&.git
https://example\&.org/bar\&.git
