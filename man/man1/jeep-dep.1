.Ss Vendoring
A project’s \c
.Sy info file
can contain dependency information in an array/tuple mapped to the 
.Ql ":dependencies"
key.
By default,
dependencies that are added or removed using 
.Ic \&jeep-dep
are added to or removed from this data structure.
Dependencies that are listed in this data structure are installed into the \c
.Sy sysroot .
This will either be the global sysroot or 
.Eo
.Pa ./_system
.Ec ,
the local sysroot,
if the user is using the 
.Fl -local
flag as described in 
.Xr jeep 1\& .
.Pp
Janet does not support the installation of multiple versions of a dependency.
To avoid version conflicts,
a user may prefer to vendor dependencies.
.Ic \&jeep-dep
supports this with the 
.Fl -vendor
option.
Vendored dependencies are listed under the 
.Ql ":vendored"
keyword and then further listed under a string that represents the directory into which the dependency will be vendored.
This allows a project author to vendor dependency for certain purposes (such as building or testing)
by vendoring dependencies into different directories.
.Pp
For more information about the \c
.Sy info file ,
the \c
.Sy bundle script
and the \c
.Sy sysroot ,
see CONCEPTS in 
.Xr jeep 1\& .

.Sh EXAMPLES
To add a dependency to the \c
.Sy info file :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ jeep dep https://example\&.org/foo\&.git
.Ed
.Pp
To remove a dependency from the \c
.Sy info file :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ jeep dep -r foo
.Ed
.Pp
To add two dependencies that will be vendored into the 
.Eo
.Pa ./bundle
.Ec
directory:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ jeep dep --vendor bundle https://example\&.org/foo\&.git
https://example\&.org/bar\&.git
